        <b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</b> is a monotypic genus
        of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
        <b>Abeliophyllum </b>distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is endangered
        in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia,
        but differs in having white, not yellow, flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are opposite,
        simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both above and
        below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the new leaves
        appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
        corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.
